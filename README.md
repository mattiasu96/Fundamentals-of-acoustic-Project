# Fundamental of acoustic Project

Project developed for the course of **_Fundamentals of acoustics_** in my 1Â° year of _Master of Science_ in **_Music & Acoustic Engineering_** @ **Politecnico di Milano**.
I studied the behavior and the generation of harmonics on an electric guitar. 

The project can be found inside the [PDF file](Foundamentals_of_acoustics_project.pdf), make sure to update your PDF reader to the latest version, the file includes audio and video demos.

There's also a **MATLAB** code which has been used to demonstrade some behaviors. Further description can be found inside the [PDF file](Foundamentals_of_acoustics_project.pdf)
