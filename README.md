# Fundamental of acoustic Project

Project developed for the course of **_Fundamentals of acoustics_** in my 1Â° year of _Master of Science_ in **_Music & Acoustic Engineering_** @ **Politecnico di Milano**.
I studied the behavior and the generation of harmonics on an electric guitar. 

The project can be found inside the [PDF file](Foundamentals_of_acoustics_project.pdf), make sure to update your PDF reader to the latest version, the file includes audio and video demos.

There's also a **MATLAB** code which has been used to demonstrade some behaviors. Further description can be found inside the [PDF file](Foundamentals_of_acoustics_project.pdf)

**NB: In order to fully enjoy the project, you should download the PDF on your local PC and install the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader. The PDF includes videos and interactive GIFs.**
